## Function overview

This node takes all information provided by the XELA Server application and broadcasts it via services and a publisher node to the ROS 1 network.

### Services
#### Service: xServStream
The `xServStream` service provided by the XELA Sensors ROS 1 node package allows users to request sensor data from the XELA Server application within the ROS network. This service can be used to retrieve information about one or more sensors connected to the XELA sensor array.

__Service Request__

* `sensor` (int): An integer representing the sensor number. Set to 0 to request data from all available sensors, or specify a specific sensor number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) to retrieve data from a single sensor.

__Service Response__

The response from the xServStream service will contain information about the requested sensor(s) in the form of ROS 1 messages. Each sensor's data is encapsulated in a xela_server_ros.msg.SensorFull message, which includes the following information:

* `message` (int): A unique identifier for the data message.
* `time` (float): The timestamp of the data message.
* `model` (str): The model name of the sensor.
* `sensor_pos` (int): The position or identifier of the sensor.
* `taxels` (list of `xela_server_ros.msg.Taxel`): A list of taxel data, including their X, Y, and Z values.
* `forces` (list of `xela_server_ros.msg.Forces`): A list of force data, including their X, Y, and Z values.

In case there is no valid data for the requested sensor(s), or if no sensor data is available at all when requesting data from all sensors, the response will contain a default sensor message with the model name set to "not_available", and no taxels nor forces present.

> Note: As only some sensors support forces, in case the user uses unsupported sensors, the forces list will be empty. The same applies if they have not enabled it in the `xServ.ini` file within the XELA Suite.

__Example Usage__

To test the xServStream service, you can use the ros service call command in a terminal. Here are some example usage scenarios:

* Request data from sensor 1:

```bash
rosservice call /xServStream 1
```
* Request data from all available sensors (sensor number set to 0):

```bash
rosservice call /xServStream 0
```
> Note: the `0` must be specified, as ROS 1 requires it.

These commands will return the latest sensor data, and the response will include the details described above.
For an example, the following is the response of the sensor if there are no details about it:
```
data: 
  - 
    message: 0
    time: 0.0
    model: "not_available"
    sensor_pos: 0
    taxels: []
    forces: []
```

In case there is valid data for the requested sensor or all sensors, the response will contain following details:
```
data: 
  - 
    message: 4507
    time: 1696911224.9756384
    model: "uSPa44"
    sensor_pos: 1
    taxels: 
      - 
        x: 33270
        y: 31184
        z: 30012
      ...
    forces: 
      - 
        x: -0.799458384513855
        y: 0.9535559415817261
        z: 1.0565017461776733
      ...
  ...
```
> Note: in case of specific sensor, the response will contain only one (the requested) sensor message in the list. There is no limit to how many sensors there can be.

### Topics / Publishers
#### Publisher: xServTopic

The `xServTopic` publisher within the XELA Sensors ROS 2 node package broadcasts sensor data to the ROS 2 network. This data is continuously published to the specified topic, and subscribers can listen to this topic to receive sensor information.

__Published Topic__
* Topic Name: `/xServTopic`
* Message Type: `xela_server_ros.msg.SensStream`

__Published Data__
The data published by the `xServTopic` publisher consists of sensor information encapsulated in ROS 2 messages of type `xela_server_ros.msg.SensStream`. Each message contains the following details:

* `sensors` (list of `xela_server_ros.msg.SensorFull`): A list of sensor data, with each sensor's information defined as follows:
  * `message` (int): A unique identifier for the data message.
  * `time` (float): The timestamp of the data message.
  * `model` (str): The model name of the sensor.
  * `sensor_pos` (int): The position or identifier of the sensor.
  * `taxels` (list of `xela_server_ros.msg.Taxel`): A list of taxel data, including their X, Y, and Z values.
  * `forces` (list of `xela_server_ros.msg.Forces`): A list of force data, including their X, Y, and Z values.

__Example Usage__
Subscribers can listen to the `/xServTopic` topic to receive real-time sensor data. You can create ROS 1 nodes or applications that subscribe to this topic to access and process the sensor information.

By subscribing to this topic, users can access the latest data from all available sensors, making it a valuable resource for integrating XELA Sensors into ROS 2 applications.

Users can also access the stream in terminal with the following command:
```bash
rostopic echo /xServTopic
```

The response will look like the following:
```
sensors:
- message: 5548
  time: 1695696620.8967698
  model: uSPa44
  sensor_pos: 1
  taxels:
  - 
    x: 49331
    y: 17509
    z: 37365
  ...
  forces:
  - 
    x: -0.13371588289737701
    y: -0.10482559353113174
    z: 5.396903038024902
  ...
...
---
```

Each packet might contain several sensors, each of which contains several taxels and forces. Each will also contain message number, initial broadcast time and sensor position defined for better tracking.

## Components
### Messages
__xela_server_ros.msg.SensorFull__
* `uint32 message` - shows the message number, used for tracking new updates
* `float64 time` - timestamp for when the message was generated (from server)
* `string model` - the model of the sensor, i.e. uSPa44
* `uint8 sensor_pos` - sensor position, stating which one it is in case there is any error with the list
* `Taxel[] taxels` - all taxels in a list, starting from top left and continuing line-by-line
* `Forces[] forces` - all forces, if available, can be empty

__xela_server_ros.msg.Taxel__
* `int16 x` - X axis value for the taxel
* `int16 y` - Y axis value for the taxel
* `int16 z` - Z axis value for the taxel

__xela_server_ros.msg.Forces__
* `float32 x`- calculated force on X axis (can be negative, depends on direction)
* `float32 y`- calculated force on Y axis (can be negative, depends on direction)
* `float32 z`- calculated force on Z axis

__xela_server_ros.msg.SensStream__
* `SensorFull[] sensors`- list of all sensors

### Services
__xela_server_ros.srv.XelaSensorStream__
* Inputs:
  * `uint8 sensor` - if none specified or set to 0, will force to return all sensors
* Outputs:
  * `SensorFull[] data` - depending on request, will contain 1 or more sensor objects
